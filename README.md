Audio-Based Cough Classification Using K-Means Clustering
This project implements an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify cough sounds using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal is to differentiate between different types of coughs based on audio features.

🚀 Features
🎵 Audio Feature Extraction
Extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from cough audio samples for robust sound representation.

🧩 Unsupervised Clustering
Groups cough patterns into clusters using the K-means algorithm without requiring labeled data.

📊 Data Visualization
Visualizes cluster distributions and results to help interpret model performance.

⚙️ Easy-to-Use Pipeline
Modular scripts for feature extraction, training, and prediction make it simple to run and extend.

🔍 Performance Metrics
Evaluates clustering quality and provides insights into model accuracy and reliability.

💻 Installation
